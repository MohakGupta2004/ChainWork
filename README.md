## Overview

The Freelance DApp is a decentralized application built on the Ethereum blockchain that connects freelancers with clients. It allows clients to post projects, freelancers to place bids, and clients to manage their projects and payments securely. The application leverages smart contracts to ensure transparency and trust in the bidding and payment processes.

## Features

### Client Features
- **Create Projects**: Clients can create new projects by providing a title, description, and budget.
- **View Bids**: Clients can view bids from freelancers for their projects.
- **Manage Projects**: Clients can mark projects as completed and make payments to freelancers.
- **Chat with freelancers**: Clients can chat with Freelancers.

### Freelancer Features
- **Browse Jobs**: Freelancers can browse available jobs and view project details.
- **Place Bids**: Freelancers can place bids on projects they are interested in.
- **Manage Bids**: Freelancers can view their accepted bids and the status of their projects.
- **Chat with clients**: Freelancers can chat with clients.
